    <p>Taal Dance Studios Edmonton was founded in 2019 and has been happily teaching dance students since. At Taal, dance isnâ€™t just about a series of steps and movements, it's all about matching your movements to your inner rhythm, your inner Taal (translated from sanskrit means rhythm).

        One hour of dance has been proven to be a more effective workout regime in comparison to one hour of walking or one hour weight lifting. Get the most out of your daily workout all the while enjoying it to an upbeat rhythm! Join the Studio today and get your first class for free! 
        
        With our small class sizes and personalized attention, you are sure to get the best guidance for your dance lessons. All classes are offered at a standard introductory rate.

    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Rucha and I am the founder and teacher at Taal. Dance has always been an activity that I have been passionate about and after learning various dance forms from ballet to indian classical for the past 15 years, I decided it was time to pass on my knowledge to the new generation of dancers!
